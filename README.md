# Sorting-Visualizer
Made a Sorting Visualizer using HTML CSS JS & BOOTSTRAP. 

# About the Project
Welcome to the Sorting-Visualizer! This project allows you to interactively visualize the inner workings of common sorting algorithms such as Bubble sort, quick sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.

The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, allowing you to generate new lists to sort and watch the algorithm in action. The visualization is helpful for anyone learning about sorting algorithms or for anyone looking to improve their understanding of how these algorithms work.

This repository is a great resource for students, educators, and developers interested in learning more about sorting algorithms and their implementation.

We hope you enjoy using this tool and learning more about sorting algorithms!
